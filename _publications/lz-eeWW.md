excerpt: 'The discrepancy between the CDF measurement and the Standard Model theoretical predictions for the $$ W $$-boson mass underscores the importance of conducting high-precision studies on the $$ W $$ boson, which is one of the predominant objectives of proposed future $$ e^+e^- $$ colliders. We investigate in detail the production of $$ W $$-boson pair at $$ e^+e^- $$ colliders and calculate the mixed QCD-EW corrections at the next-to-next-to-leading order. By employing the method of differential equations, we analytically compute the two-loop master integrals for the mixed QCD-EW corrections to  $$ e^+ e^- \to W^+ W^- $$. By utilizing the Magnus transformation, we derive a canonical set of master integrals for each integral family. This canonical basis fulfills a system of differential equations where the dependence on the dimensional regulator, $$ \epsilon $$, is linearly factorized from the kinematics. Finally, these canonical master integrals are given as Taylor series in $$ \epsilon $$ up to $$\epsilon^4$$, with coefficients written as combinations of Goncharov polylogarithms up to weight four. Upon applying our analytic expressions of these master integrals to the phenomenological analysis on $$W$$-pair production, we find that the $$\Oas$$ corrections hold substantial significance in the $$ \alpha(0) $$ scheme, especially in the vicinity of the top-pair resonance ($$ \sqrt{s} = 2\, m_t $$) induced by top-loop integrals. However, these corrections can be heavily suppressed by adopting the $$ G_{\mu} $$ scheme.'
