excerpt: 'We calculate the two-loop mixed QCD$$ \otimes $$EW corrections for the charged Higgs boson pair production within the framework of four types of Two Higgs Doublet Models (THDMs) with the $$ Z_2 $$ symmetry. We analyze in detail the dependences of our results on physical parameters, including the charged Higgs mass, $$ \tan\beta $$, the scattering angle, and the colliding energy. It is noticeable that the mixed QCD$$ \otimes $$EW relative correction is independent of the scattering angle due to the topology of Feynman diagrams at $$ O(\alpha\alpha_s) $$. Numerical results in most allowed regions of four types of THDMs are provided in the density plots on the $$ m_{H^{\pm}} $$-$$ \tan\beta $$ plane. For type-I and type-X, the mixed QCD$$ \otimes $$EW relative correction varies slightly near $$ 1\% $$ except in the vicinity of resonance. For type-II and type-Y, the corrections increase consistently in large $$ \tan\beta $$ region and reach up to $$ 11.5\% $$ at $$ \tan\beta = 50 $$. We also compute the $$ O(\alpha) $$ corrections to obtain the corrected cross section up to $$ O(\alpha\alpha_s) $$. The numerical results show that the corrected cross section can be larger than $$ 80\ \mathrm{fb} $$ in some parameter space region for type-I and type-X THDMs.'
