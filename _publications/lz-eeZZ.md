excerpt: 'We present a comprehensive analytic calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order $$ \text{QCD} \otimes \text{EW }$$ corrections to $$ Z $$-boson pair production at electron-positron colliders. The two-loop master integrals essential to this calculation are evaluated using the differential equation method. In this work, we detail the formulation and solution of the canonical differential equations for the two-loop three-point master integrals with two on-shell $$ Z $$ boson external legs and a massive internal quark loop. These canonical master integrals are systematically given as Taylor series in the dimensional regulator, $$ \epsilon = (4-d)/2 $$, up to order four, with coefficients expressed in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms up to weight four. Upon applying our analytic master integrals in the context of phenomenological analysis, we observe that the $$ \mathcal{O}(\alpha \alpha_s) $$ corrections manifest at a level of approximately one percent compared to the leading-order predictions and thus cannot be overlooked in future comparisons with high precision experimental data.'
